1. Pinpoint Your Values
    1. The gym. I love to workout and I do it first thing in the morning every morning!
    2. Coding problems. I hate to leave things unfinished, so if I can't solve a coding problem before I go to sleep, my mind will be running trying to figure out a solution.
    3. At the gym or solving coding problems
    4. I'm bothered when I can't figure something out. I think this bothers me because I believe that everyone should be able to code since humans are the ones who created it.
