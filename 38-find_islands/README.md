# Find Island
- Create a function that brings an an adjacency matrix and determines whether or not there are any islands. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the number of islands present in the graph data structure.

## Challenge
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
